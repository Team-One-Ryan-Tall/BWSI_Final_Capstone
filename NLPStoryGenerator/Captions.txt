located in the large magellanic cloud one of our neighbouring dwarf galaxies this young globular like star cluster is surrounded by a pattern of filamentary nebulosity that is thought to have been created during supernova blasts it consists of a main globular cluster in the centre and a younger smaller cluster seen below and to the right composed of extremely hot blue stars and fainter red t tauri stars this wide variety of stars allows a thorough study of star formation processes 

huge waves are sculpted in this two lobed nebula some light years away in the constellation of sagittarius this warm planetary nebula harbours one of the hottest stars known and its powerful stellar winds generate waves billion kilometres high the waves are caused by supersonic shocks formed when the local gas is compressed and heated in front of the rapidly expanding lobes the atoms caught in the shock emit the spectacular radiation seen in this image 

against a stunning backdrop of thousands of galaxies this odd looking galaxy with the long streamer of stars appears to be racing through space like a runaway pinwheel firework this picture of the galaxy ugc was taken by the advanced camera for surveys acs which was installed aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope in march during servicing mission b dubbed the tadpole this spiral galaxy is unlike the textbook images of stately galaxies its distorted shape was caused by a small interloper a very blue compact galaxy visible in the upper left corner of the more massive tadpole the tadpole resides about million light years away in the constellation draco seen shining through the tadpoles disc the tiny intruder is likely a hit and run galaxy that is now leaving the scene of the accident strong gravitational forces from the interaction created the long tail of stars and gas stretching out more than light years numerous young blue stars and star clusters spawned by the galaxy collision are seen in the spiral arms as well as in the long tidal tail of stars each of these clusters represents the formation of up to about a million stars their colour is blue because they contain very massive stars which are times hotter and million times brighter than our sun once formed the star clusters become redder with age as the most massive and bluest stars exhaust their fuel and burn out these clusters will eventually become old globular clusters similar to those found in essentially all halos of galaxies including our own milky way two prominent clumps of young bright blue stars are visible in the tidal tale and separated by a gap these clumps of stars will likely become dwarf galaxies that orbit in the tadpoles halo behind the galactic carnage and torrent of star birth is another compelling picture a wallpaper pattern of about faint galaxies these galaxies represent twice the number of those found in the legendary hubble deep field the orbiting observatorys deepest view of the heavens taken in by the wide field and planetary camera the galaxies in the acs picture like those in the hubble deep field stretch back to nearly the beginning of time they are a myriad of shapes and represent fossil samples of the universes billion year evolution the acs picture was taken in one twelfth the time it took to observe the hubble deep field in blue light acs discovered even fainter objects than those in the deep field the cameras vision is so sharp that astronomers can identify distant colliding galaxies the building blocks of galaxies an exquisite whitmans sampler of normal galaxies and presumably extremely faraway galaxies acs made this observation on and april the colour image is constructed from three separate images taken in near infrared orange and blue filters image credit nasa the acs science team h ford g illingworth m clampin g hartig t allen k anderson f bartko n benitez j blakeslee r bouwens t broadhurst r brown c burrows d campbell e cheng n cross p feldman m franx d golimowski c gronwall r kimble j krist m lesser d magee a martel w j mccann g meurer g miley m postman p rosati m sirianni w sparks p sullivan h tran z tsvetanov r white and r woodruff and esa

advanced camera for surveys acs the newest camera on nasa esa hubble space telescope has captured a spectacular pair of galaxies engaged in a celestial dance of cat and mouse or in this case mouse and mouse located million light years away in the constellation coma berenices the colliding galaxies have been nicknamed the mice because of the long tails of stars and gas emanating from each galaxy otherwise known as ngc the pair will eventually merge into a single giant galaxy 

resembling a nightmarish beast rearing its head from a crimson sea this celestial object is actually just a pillar of gas and dust called the cone nebula in ngc so named because in ground based images it has a conical shape this monstrous pillar resides in a turbulent star forming region this picture taken by the newly installed advanced camera for surveys acs aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows the upper light years of the cone a height that equals million roundtrips to the moon the entire pillar is seven light years long radiation from hot young stars located beyond the top of the image has slowly eroded the nebula over millions of years ultraviolet light heats the edges of the dark cloud releasing gas into the relatively empty region of surrounding space there additional ultraviolet radiation causes the hydrogen gas to glow which produces the red halo of light seen around the pillar a similar process occurs on a much smaller scale to gas surrounding a single star forming the bow shaped arc seen near the upper left side of the cone this arc seen previously with the hubble telescope is times larger than the diameter of our solar system the blue white light from surrounding stars is reflected by dust background stars can be seen peeking through the evaporating tendrils of gas while the turbulent base is pockmarked with stars reddened by dust over time only the densest regions of the cone will be left but inside these regions stars and planets may form the cone nebula resides light years away in the constellation monoceros the cone is a cousin of the m pillars which the hubble telescope imaged in consisting mainly of cold gas the pillars in both regions resist being eroded away by the blistering ultraviolet radiation from young massive stars pillars like the cone and m are common in large regions of star birth astronomers believe that these pillars may be incubators for developing stars the acs made this observation on april the colour image is constructed from three separate images taken in blue near infrared and hydrogen alpha filters image credit nasa the acs science team h ford g illingworth m clampin g hartig t allen k anderson f bartko n benitez j blakeslee r bouwens t broadhurst r brown c burrows d campbell e cheng n cross p feldman m franx d golimowski c gronwall r kimble j krist m lesser d magee a martel w j mccann g meurer g miley m postman p rosati m sirianni w sparks p sullivan h tran z tsvetanov r white and r woodruff and esa

galaxies galaxies everywhere as far as the nasa esa hubble space telescope can see this view of nearly galaxies is the deepest visible light image of the cosmos called the hubble ultra deep field this galaxy studded view represents a deep core sample of the universe cutting across billions of light years the snapshot includes galaxies of various ages sizes shapes and colours the smallest reddest galaxies about may be among the most distant known existing when the universe was just million years old the nearest galaxies the larger brighter well defined spirals and ellipticals thrived about billion years ago when the cosmos was billion years old in vibrant contrast to the rich harvest of classic spiral and elliptical galaxies there is a zoo of oddball galaxies littering the field some look like toothpicks others like links on a bracelet a few appear to be interacting these oddball galaxies chronicle a period when the universe was younger and more chaotic order and structure were just beginning to emerge the ultra deep field observations taken by the advanced camera for surveys represent a narrow deep view of the cosmos peering into the ultra deep field is like looking through a metre long soda straw in ground based photographs the patch of sky in which the galaxies reside just one tenth the diameter of the full moon is largely empty located in the constellation fornax the region is so empty that only a handful of stars within the milky way galaxy can be seen in the image in this image blue and green correspond to colours that can be seen by the human eye such as hot young blue stars and the glow of sun like stars in the disks of galaxies red represents near infrared light which is invisible to the human eye such as the red glow of dust enshrouded galaxies the image required exposures taken over the course of hubble orbits around earth the total amount of exposure time was days taken between sept and jan 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope captures the iridescent tapestry of star birth in a neighbouring galaxy in this panoramic view of glowing gas dark dust clouds and young hot stars the star forming region catalogued as nb lies in the large magellanic cloud lmc located only light years from earth with its high resolution the hubble space telescope is able to view details of star formation in the lmc as easily as ground based telescopes are able to observe stellar formation within our own milky way galaxy our neighbourhood galaxy the large magellanic cloud lmc lies in the constellation of dorado and is sprinkled with a number of regions harbouring recent and ongoing star formation one of these star forming region nb is shown in this hubble image it is a subregion within a larger area of star formation called n n is the second largest star forming region in lmc it is only surpassed in the size and activity by the king of stellar nurseries doradus located at the opposite side of lmc 

the hubble space telescopes latest image of the star v monocerotis v mon reveals dramatic changes in the illumination of surrounding dusty cloud structures the effect called a light echo has been unveiling never before seen dust patterns ever since the star suddenly brightened for several weeks in early 

the graceful winding arms of the majestic spiral galaxy m ngc appear like a grand spiral staircase sweeping through space they are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust this sharpest ever image taken in january with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope illustrates a spiral galaxys grand design from its curving spiral arms where young stars reside to its yellowish central core a home of older stars the galaxy is nicknamed the whirlpool because of its swirling structure the whirlpools most striking feature is its two curving arms a hallmark of so called grand design spiral galaxies many spiral galaxies possess numerous loosely shaped arms that make their spiral structure less pronounced these arms serve an important purpose in spiral galaxies they are star formation factories compressing hydrogen gas and creating clusters of new stars in the whirlpool the assembly line begins with the dark clouds of gas on the inner edge then moves to bright pink star forming regions and ends with the brilliant blue star clusters along the outer edge some astronomers believe that the whirlpools arms are so prominent because of the effects of a close encounter with ngc the small yellowish galaxy at the outermost tip of one of the whirlpools arms at first glance the compact galaxy appears to be tugging on the arm hubbles clear view however shows that ngc is passing behind the whirlpool the small galaxy has been gliding past the whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years as ngc drifts by its gravitational muscle pumps up waves within the whirlpools pancake shaped disk the waves are like ripples in a pond generated when a rock is thrown in the water when the waves pass through orbiting gas clouds within the disk they squeeze the gaseous material along each arms inner edge the dark dusty material looks like gathering storm clouds these dense clouds collapse creating a wake of star birth as seen in the bright pink star forming regions the largest stars eventually sweep away the dusty cocoons with a torrent of radiation hurricane like stellar winds and shock waves from supernova blasts bright blue star clusters emerge from the mayhem illuminating the whirlpools arms like city streetlights the whirlpool is one of astronomys galactic darlings located approximately million light years away in the constellation canes venatici the hunting dogs the whirlpools beautiful face on view and closeness to earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxys structure and star forming processes 

appearing like a winged fairy tale creature poised on a pedestal this object is actually a billowing tower of cold gas and dust rising from a stellar nursery called the eagle nebula the soaring tower is light years or about trillion kilometres high about twice the distance from our sun to the next nearest star stars in the eagle nebula are born in clouds of cold hydrogen gas that reside in chaotic neighbourhoods where energy from young stars sculpts fantasy like landscapes in the gas the tower may be a giant incubator for those newborn stars a torrent of ultraviolet light from a band of massive hot young stars off the top of the image is eroding the pillar the starlight also is responsible for illuminating the towers rough surface ghostly streamers of gas can be seen boiling off this surface creating the haze around the structure and highlighting its three dimensional shape the column is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas the edge of the dark hydrogen cloud at the top of the tower is resisting erosion in a manner similar to that of brush among a field of prairie grass that is being swept up by fire the fire quickly burns the grass but slows down when it encounters the dense brush in this celestial case thick clouds of hydrogen gas and dust have survived longer than their surroundings in the face of a blast of ultraviolet light from the hot young stars inside the gaseous tower stars may be forming some of those stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars the first wave of stars may have started forming before the massive star cluster began venting its scorching light the star birth may have begun when denser regions of cold gas within the tower started collapsing under their own weight to make stars the bumps and fingers of material in the centre of the tower are examples of these stellar birthing areas these regions may look small but they are roughly the size of our solar system the fledgling stars continued to grow as they fed off the surrounding gas cloud they abruptly stopped growing when light from the star cluster uncovered their gaseous cradles separating them from their gas supply ironically the young clusters intense starlight may be inducing star formation in some regions of the tower examples can be seen in the large glowing clumps and finger shaped protrusions at the top of the structure the stars may be heating the gas at the top of the tower and creating a shock front as seen by the bright rim of material tracing the edge of the nebula at top left as the heated gas expands it acts like a battering ram pushing against the darker cold gas the intense pressure compresses the gas making it easier for stars to form this scenario may continue as the shock front moves slowly down the tower the dominant colours in the image were produced by gas energized by the star clusters powerful ultraviolet light the blue colour at the top is from glowing oxygen the red colon in the lower region is from glowing hydrogen the eagle nebula image was taken in november with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope 

this hubble space telescope view shows one of the most dynamic and intricately detailed star forming regions in space located light years away in the small magellanic cloud smc a satellite galaxy of our milky way at the centre of the region is a brilliant star cluster called ngc a dramatic structure of arched ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surrounds the cluster   a torrent of radiation from the hot stars in the cluster ngc at the centre of this hubble image eats into denser areas around it creating a fantasy sculpture of dust and gas the dark intricately beaded edge of the ridge seen in silhouette is particularly dramatic it contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster like windsocks caught in a gale 

this hubble image gives the most detailed view of the entire crab nebula ever the crab is among the most interesting and well studied objects in astronomy this image is the largest image ever taken with hubbles wfpc camera it was assembled from individual exposures taken with the nasa esa hubble space telescope and is the highest resolution image of the entire crab nebula ever made 

this dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming the image taken by the advanced camera for surveys acs aboard nasa esa hubble space telescope represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region called the orion nebula more than stars of various sizes appear in this image some of them have never been seen in visible light these stars reside in a dramatic dust and gas landscape of plateaus mountains and valleys that are reminiscent of the grand canyon the orion nebula is a picture book of star formation from the massive young stars that are shaping the nebula to the pillars of dense gas that may be the homes of budding stars the bright central region is the home of the four heftiest stars in the nebula the stars are called the trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoid pattern ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars located near the trapezium stars are stars still young enough to have disks of material encircling them these disks are called protoplanetary disks or proplyds and are too small to see clearly in this image the disks are the building blocks of solar systems the bright glow at upper left is from m a small region being shaped by a massive young stars ultraviolet light astronomers call the region a miniature orion nebula because only one star is sculpting the landscape the orion nebula has four such stars next to m are dense dark pillars of dust and gas that point toward the trapezium these pillars are resisting erosion from the trapeziums intense ultraviolet light the glowing region on the right reveals arcs and bubbles formed when stellar winds streams of charged particles ejected from the trapezium stars collide with material the faint red stars near the bottom are the myriad brown dwarfs that hubble spied for the first time in the nebula in visible light sometimes called failed stars brown dwarfs are cool objects that are too small to be ordinary stars because they cannot sustain nuclear fusion in their cores the way our sun does the dark red column below left shows an illuminated edge of the cavity wall the orion nebula is light years away the nearest star forming region to earth astronomers used hubble images taken in five colours to make this picture they also added ground based photos to fill out the nebula the acs mosaic covers approximately the apparent angular size of the full moon the orion observations were taken between and 

this new hubble image reveals the gigantic pinwheel galaxy one of the best known examples of grand design spirals and its supergiant star forming regions in unprecedented detail the image is the largest and most detailed photo of a spiral galaxy ever taken with hubble 

this mosaic image of the magnificent starburst galaxy messier m is the sharpest wide angle view ever obtained of m it is a galaxy remarkable for its webs of shredded clouds and flame like plumes of glowing hydrogen blasting out from its central regions where young stars are being born times faster than they are inside in our milky way galaxy 

this image depicts bright blue newly formed stars that are blowing a cavity in the centre of a fascinating star forming region known as n the high energy radiation blazing out from the hot young stars in n is eroding the outer portions of the nebula from the inside as the diffuse outer reaches of the nebula prevent the energetic outflows from streaming away from the cluster directly because n is located far from the central body of the small magellanic cloud numerous background galaxies in this picture can be seen delivering a grand backdrop for the stellar newcomers the dust in the region gives these distant galaxies a reddish brown tint 

the barred spiral galaxy ngc showing up clusters of hot young blue stars along its spiral arms and clouds of hydrogen gas glowing in red delicate curtains of dust partially obscure and redden the light of the stars behind them ngc s symmetric look is emphasised by the four principal arms edged by eye catching dust lanes that extend out from the centre 

hubbles view of the carina nebula shows star birth in a new level of detail the fantasy like landscape of the nebula is sculpted by the action of outflowing winds and scorching ultraviolet radiation from the monster stars that inhabit this inferno in the process these stars are shredding the surrounding material that is the last vestige of the giant cloud from which the stars were born the immense nebula is an estimated light years away in the southern constellation carina the keel of the old southern constellation argo navis the ship of jason and the argonauts from greek mythology this image is a mosaic of the carina nebula assembled from frames taken with hubble space telescopes advanced camera for surveys the hubble images were taken in the light of ionized hydrogen colour information was added with data taken at the cerro tololo inter american observatory in chile red corresponds to sulfur green to hydrogen and blue to oxygen emission 

the star forming region ngc seen here in the latest hubble space telescope image contains one of the most impressive massive young star clusters in the milky way bathed in gas and dust the cluster formed in a huge rush of star formation thought to have occurred around a million years ago the hot blue stars at the core are responsible for carving out a huge cavity in the gas seen to the right of the star cluster in ngc s centre 

in the new hubble image of the galaxy m we can also see a smattering of bright pink regions decorating the spiral arms these are huge relatively short lived clouds of hydrogen gas which glow due to the strong radiation from hot young stars embedded within them glowing pink regions of ionized hydrogen hydrogen that has lost its electrons these regions of star formation show an excess of light at ultraviolet wavelengths and astronomers call them hii regions 

the picture shows abell a rich galaxy cluster composed of thousands of individual galaxies it sits about billion light years from the earth redshift in the northern constellation of draco when used by astronomers as a powerful gravitational lens to magnify distant galaxies the cluster allows them to peer far into the universe however it not only magnifies the images of hidden galaxies but also distorts them into long thin arcs several arcs in the image can be studied in detail thanks to hubbles sharp vision multiple distorted images of the same galaxies can be identified by comparing the shape of the galaxies and their colour in addition to the giant arcs many smaller arclets have been identified 

located in the northern celestial hemisphere abell is composed of over one hundred different galaxies that act as a powerful cosmic telescope or gravitational lens the gravitational lens produced by the massive galaxy cluster in the foreground the yellow mostly elliptical galaxies scattered across the image bends the light rays in a way that can stretch the images and so amplify the brightness of the light rays from more distant galaxies in the process it distorts their shapes and produces multiple banana shaped images of the original galaxies the result is the stunning image seen here a view deeper into the universe than possible with current technology alone abell is located at billion light years from the earth redshift 

this stunning image of ngc was taken using the nasa esa hubble space telescopes advanced camera for surveys in july and august it provides amazing detail and resolution of the fragile filamentary structures which show up as a reddish lacy structure surrounding the central bright galaxy ngc these filaments are cool despite being surrounded by gas that is around million degrees celsius hot they are suspended in a magnetic field which maintains their structure and demonstrates how energy from the central black hole is transferred to the surrounding gas by observing the filamentary structure astronomers were for the first time able to estimate the magnetic fields strength using this information they demonstrated how the extragalactic magnetic fields have maintained the structure of the filaments against collapse caused by either gravitational forces or the violence of the surrounding cluster during their million year lifetime this is the first time astronomers have been able to differentiate the individual threads making up such filaments to this degree astonishingly they distinguished threads a mere light years across by contrast the filaments seen here can be a gaping light years long the entire image is approximately light years across also seen in the image are impressive lanes of dust from a separate spiral galaxy it lies partly in front of the giant elliptical central cluster galaxy and has been completed disrupted by the tidal gravitational forces within the galaxy cluster several striking filaments of blue newborn stars are seen crossing the image 

the image shows a pair of colossal stars wr and tr located within the open cluster trumpler this cluster is embedded within the carina nebula an immense cauldron of gas and dust that lies approximately light years from earth in the constellation of carina the keel wr is the brightest situated near the centre of the image the neighbouring tr is the third brightest just to the upper left of wr the second brightest to the left of wr is a low mass star located much closer to the earth than the carina nebula 

wr and tr at the bottom of the image are located within the open cluster trumpler this cluster is embedded within the carina nebula an immense cauldron of gas and dust that lies approximately light years from earth in the constellation of carina the keel at the top of the image a peculiar nebula with the shape of a defiant finger points towards wr and tr 

this close up view of saturns disc captures the transit of several moons across the face of the gas giant planet the giant orange moon titan larger than the planet mercury can be seen at upper right the white icy moons that are much closer to saturn hence much closer to the ring plane in this view are from left to right enceladus dione and mimas the dark band running across the face of the planet slightly above the rings is the shadow of the rings cast on the planet this picture was taken with hubbles wide field planetary camera on february when saturn was at a distance of roughly billion kilometres from earth hubble can see details as small as kilometres across on saturn 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope captured this image of ngc in the constellation of indus in the southern sky a family of globular clusters appears as glittering spots dusted around the galaxy halo astronomers study the globular clusters in ngc to learn more about its formation and evolution the dust lanes which appear as a lacy web are dramatically backlit by the millions of stars in the halo of ngc 

composed of gas and dust the pictured pillar resides in a tempestuous stellar nursery called the carina nebula located light years away in the southern constellation of carina taken in visible light the image shows the tip of the three light year long pillar bathed in the glow of light from hot massive stars off the top of the image scorching radiation and fast winds streams of charged particles from these stars are sculpting the pillar and causing new stars to form within it streamers of gas and dust can be seen flowing off the top of the structure hubbles wide field camera observed the carina nebula on july wfc was installed aboard hubble in may during servicing mission the composite image was made from filters that isolate emission from iron magnesium oxygen hydrogen and sulphur these hubble observations of the carina nebula are part of the hubble servicing mission early release observations 

this celestial object looks like a delicate butterfly but it is far from serene what resemble dainty butterfly wings are actually roiling cauldrons of gas heated to nearly degrees celsius the gas is tearing across space at more than kilometres per hour fast enough to travel from earth to the moon in minutes a dying star that was once about five times the mass of the sun is at the centre of this fury it has ejected its envelope of gases and is now unleashing a stream of ultraviolet radiation that is making the cast off material glow this object is an example of a planetary nebula so named because many of them have a round appearance resembling that of a planet when viewed through a small telescope the wide field camera wfc a new camera aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope snapped this image of the planetary nebula catalogued as ngc but more popularly called the bug nebula or the butterfly nebula wfc was installed by nasa astronauts in may during the servicing mission to upgrade and repair the year old hubble ngc lies within our milky way galaxy roughly light years away in the constellation of scorpius the glowing gas is the stars outer layers expelled over about years the butterfly stretches for more than two light years which is about half the distance from the sun to the nearest star proxima centauri the central star itself cannot be seen because it is hidden within a doughnut shaped ring of dust which appears as a dark band pinching the nebula in the centre the thick dust belt constricts the stars outflow creating the classic bipolar or hourglass shape displayed by some planetary nebulae the stars surface temperature is estimated to be over degrees celsius making it one of the hottest known stars in our galaxy spectroscopic observations made with ground based telescopes show that the gas is roughly degrees celsius which is unusually hot compared to a typical planetary nebula the wfc image reveals a complex history of ejections from the star the star first evolved into a huge red giant with a diameter of about times that of our sun it then lost its extended outer layers some of this gas was cast off from its equator at a relatively slow speed perhaps as low as kilometres per hour creating the doughnut shaped ring other gas was ejected perpendicular to the ring at higher speeds producing the elongated wings of the butterfly shaped structure later as the central star heated up a much faster stellar wind a stream of charged particles travelling at more than million kilometres per hour ploughed through the existing wing shaped structure further modifying its shape the image also shows numerous finger like projections pointing back to the star which may mark denser blobs in the outflow that have resisted the pressure from the stellar wind the nebulas reddish outer edges are largely due to light emitted by nitrogen which marks the coolest gas visible in the picture wfc is equipped with a wide variety of filters that isolate light emitted by various chemical elements allowing astronomers to infer properties of the nebular gas such as its temperature density and composition the white coloured regions are areas where light is emitted by sulphur these are regions where fast moving gas overtakes and collides with slow moving gas that left the star at an earlier time producing shock waves in the gas the bright white edges on the sides facing the central star the white blob with the crisp edge at upper right is an example of one of those shock waves ngc was imaged on july with hubbles wide field camera in ultraviolet and visible light filters that isolate emissions from oxygen helium hydrogen nitrogen and sulphur from the planetary nebula were used to create this composite image these hubble observations of the planetary nebula ngc are part of the hubble servicing mission early release observations 

a clash among members of a famous galaxy quintet reveals an assortment of stars across a wide colour range from young blue stars to aging red stars this portrait of stephans quintet also known as the hickson compact group was taken by the new wide field camera wfc aboard the nasa esa hubble space telescope stephans quintet as the name implies is a group of five galaxies the name however is a bit of a misnomer studies have shown that group member ngc at upper left is actually a foreground galaxy that is about seven times closer to earth than the rest of the group three of the galaxies have distorted shapes elongated spiral arms and long gaseous tidal tails containing myriad star clusters proof of their close encounters these interactions have sparked a frenzy of star birth in the central pair of galaxies this drama is being played out against a rich backdrop of faraway galaxies the image taken in visible and near infrared light showcases wfcs broad wavelength range the colours trace the ages of the stellar populations showing that star birth occurred at different epochs stretching over hundreds of millions of years the cameras infrared vision also peers through curtains of dust to see groupings of stars that cannot be seen in visible light ngc at top right is a barred spiral with distinct spiral arms that follow nearly degrees back to the bar the blue specks in the spiral arm at the top of ngc and the red dots just above and to the right of the core are clusters of many thousands of stars most of the quintet is too far away even for hubble to resolve individual stars continuing clockwise the next galaxy appears to have two cores but it is actually two galaxies ngc a and ngc b encircling the galaxies are young bright blue star clusters and pinkish clouds of glowing hydrogen where infant stars are being born these stars are less than million years old and have not yet blown away their natal cloud far away from the galaxies at right is a patch of intergalactic space where many star clusters are forming ngc at bottom left is a normal looking elliptical galaxy that is less affected by the interactions sharply contrasting with these galaxies is the dwarf galaxy ngc at upper left bursts of star formation are occurring in the galaxys disc as seen by the blue and pink dots in this galaxy hubble can resolve individual stars evidence that ngc is closer to earth ngc is million light years from earth the other members of the quintet reside about million light years away in the constellation pegasus these more distant members are markedly redder than the foreground galaxy suggesting that older stars reside in their cores the stars light also may be further reddened by dust stirred up in the encounters spied by edouard m stephan in stephans quintet is the first compact group ever discovered wfc observed the quintet in july and august the composite image was made by using filters that isolate light from the blue green and infrared portions of the spectrum as well as emission from ionised hydrogen these hubble observations are part of the hubble servicing mission early release observations nasa astronauts installed the wfc camera during a servicing mission in may to upgrade and repair the year old hubble telescope 

this hubble picture taken on july is the first full disc natural colour image of jupiter made with hubbles new camera the wide field camera wfc it is the sharpest visible light picture of jupiter since the new horizons spacecraft flew by that planet in each pixel in this high resolution image spans about kilometres in jupiters atmosphere jupiter was more than million kilometres from earth when the images were taken the dark smudge at bottom right is debris from a comet or asteroid that plunged into jupiters atmosphere and disintegrated in addition to the fresh impact the image reveals a spectacular variety of shapes in the swirling atmosphere of jupiter the planet is wrapped in bands of yellow brown and white clouds these bands are produced by the atmosphere flowing in different directions at various places when these opposing flows interact turbulence appears such data complement the images taken from other telescopes and spacecraft by providing exquisite details of atmospheric phenomena for example the image suggests that dark barges tracked by amateur astronomers on a nightly basis may differ both in form and colour from barge features identified by the voyager spacecraft the great red spot and the smaller red oval are both out of view on the other side of the planet this colour image is a composite of three separate colour exposures red blue and green made by wfc additional processing was done to compensate for asynchronous imaging in the colour filters and other effects 

this is the first image of a celestial object taken with the newly repaired advanced camera for surveys acs the camera was restored to operation during the sts servicing mission to upgrade the nasa esa hubble space telescope the barred spiral galaxy ngc was photographed on june and july as part of the initial testing and calibration of hubbles acs the galaxy lies up to million light years away in the north circumpolar constellation ursa major 

hubbles advanced camera for surveys acs allows astronomers to study an interesting and important phenomenon called ram pressure stripping that is so powerful it is capable of mangling galaxies and even halting their star formation ngc is a spectacular example of a spiral galaxy that is currently being stripped of its gas content the galaxy is part of the virgo galaxy cluster and its rapid motion within the cluster results in strong winds across the galaxy as the gas within is left behind scientists estimate that the galaxy is moving at more than million kilometres per hour a number of newly formed star clusters that developed in the stripped gas can be seen in the hubble image the stripped spiral galaxy is located some million light years away from earth even though it is a still image hubbles view of ngc practically swirls off the page with apparent movement it highlights the dramatic state of the galaxy with an especially vivid view of the ghostly gas being forced out of it bright blue pockets of new star formation can be seen to the right and left of centre 

this craggy fantasy mountaintop enshrouded by wispy clouds looks like a bizarre landscape from tolkiens the lord of the rings the nasa esa hubble space telescope image which is even more dramatic than fiction captures the chaotic activity atop a pillar of gas and dust three light years tall which is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars the pillar is also being assaulted from within as infant stars buried inside it fire off jets of gas that can be seen streaming from towering peaks this turbulent cosmic pinnacle lies within a tempestuous stellar nursery called the carina nebula located light years away in the southern constellation of carina the image celebrates the th anniversary of hubbles launch and deployment into an orbit around the earth scorching radiation and fast winds streams of charged particles from super hot newborn stars in the nebula are shaping and compressing the pillar causing new stars to form within it streamers of hot ionised gas can be seen flowing off the ridges of the structure and wispy veils of gas and dust illuminated by starlight float around its towering peaks the denser parts of the pillar are resisting being eroded by radiation nestled inside this dense mountain are fledgling stars long streamers of gas can be seen shooting in opposite directions from the pedestal at the top of the image another pair of jets is visible at another peak near the centre of the image these jets known as hh and hh respectively are signposts for new star birth and are launched by swirling gas and dust discs around the young stars which allow material to slowly accrete onto the stellar surfaces hubbles wide field camera observed the pillar on february the colours in this composite image correspond to the glow of oxygen blue hydrogen and nitrogen green and sulphur red 

star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the universe it plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies and it is also in the earliest stages of star formation that planetary systems first appear yet there is still much that astronomers dont understand such as how do the properties of stellar nurseries vary according to the composition and density of gas present and what triggers star formation in the first place the driving force behind star formation is particularly unclear for a type of galaxy called a flocculent spiral such as ngc shown here which features short spiral arms rather than prominent and well defined galactic limbs 

hubble has taken this stunning close up shot of part of the tarantula nebula this star forming region of ionised hydrogen gas is in the large magellanic cloud a small galaxy which neighbours the milky way it is home to many extreme conditions including supernova remnants and the heaviest star ever found the tarantula nebula is the most luminous nebula of its type  in the local universe 

this image of a pair of interacting galaxies called arp was released to celebrate the st anniversary of the launch of the nasa esa hubble space telescope the distorted shape of the larger of the two galaxies shows signs of tidal interactions with the smaller of the two it is thought that the smaller galaxy has actually passed through the larger one 

centaurus a also known as ngc is well known for its dramatic dusty lanes of dark material hubbles new observations using its most advanced instrument the wide field camera are the most detailed ever made of this galaxy they have been combined here in a multi wavelength image which reveals never before seen detail in the dusty portion of the galaxy as well as features in the visible spectrum this composite shows ultraviolet light which comes from young stars and near infrared light which lets us glimpse some of the detail otherwise obscured by the dust 

this image from the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows sh or s for short this is a compact star forming region in the constellation cygnus the swan a newly formed star called s ir is shrouded in dust at the centre of the image and is responsible for the surrounding gas clouds hourglass like shape and the turbulence visible within light from glowing hydrogen is coloured blue in this image 

this image combines hubble observations of m with additional information captured by amateur astronomers robert gendler and jay gabany gendler combined hubble data with his own observations to produce this stunning colour image m is a relatively nearby spiral galaxy a little over million light years away 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope has captured this vivid image of spiral galaxy messier a galaxy in the constellation of cetus some million light years away from us the streaks of red and blue in the image highlight pockets of star formation along the pinwheeling arms with dark dust lanes stretching across the galaxys starry centre the galaxy belongs to a class of galaxies known as seyfert galaxies which have highly ionised gas surrounding an intensely active centre 

this new hubble image captured and released to celebrate the telescopes rd year in orbit shows part of the sky in the constellation of orion the hunter rising like a giant seahorse from turbulent waves of dust and gas is the horsehead nebula otherwise known as barnard this image shows the region in infrared light which has longer wavelengths than visible light and can pierce through the dusty material that usually obscures the nebulas inner regions the result is a rather ethereal and fragile looking structure made of delicate folds of gas very different to the nebulas appearance in visible light 

this new image shows the dramatic shape and colour of the ring nebula otherwise known as messier from earths perspective the nebula looks like a simple elliptical shape with a shaggy boundary however new observations combining existing ground based data with new nasa esa hubble space telescope data show that the nebula is shaped like a distorted doughnut this doughnut has a rugby ball shaped region of lower density material slotted into in its central gap stretching towards and away from us 

this hubble image shows rs puppis a type of variable star known as a cepheid variable as variable stars go cepheids have comparatively long periods rs puppis for example varies in brightness by almost a factor of five every or so days rs puppis is unusual this variable star is shrouded by thick dark clouds of dust enabling a phenomenon known as a light echo to be shown with stunning clarity these hubble observations show the ethereal object embedded in its dusty environment set against a dark sky filled with background galaxies 

to celebrate its th year in orbit the nasa esa hubble space telescope has released this beautiful new image of part of ngc also known as the monkey head nebula ngc lies about light years away in the constellation of orion the hunter hubble previously viewed this part of the sky back in the colourful region is filled with young stars embedded within bright wisps of cosmic gas and dust this portion of the monkey head nebula was imaged in the infrared using hubbles wide field camera 

this full disc image of jupiter was taken on april with hubbles wide field camera wfc 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope has revisited one of its most iconic and popular images the eagle nebulas pillars of creation this image shows the pillars as seen in visible light capturing the multi coloured glow of gas clouds wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust and the rust coloured elephants trunks of the nebulas famous pillars the dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds from massive nearby stars with these new images comes better contrast and a clearer view for astronomers to study how the structure of the pillars is changing over time 

ngc is a spiral galaxy million light years from earth a relatively close neighbour in cosmic terms the galaxy has witnessed some violent and dramatic events in its recent past tell tale signs of this brutality can be seen in ngc s strangely shaped arms and in the smoky golden haze that stretches out from the galactic centre caused by an ongoing merger with its smaller galactic companion ngc which is out of the frame of this image 

 this nasa esa hubble space telescope image of the cluster westerlund and its surroundings has been released to celebrate hubbles th year in orbit and a quarter of a century of new discoveries stunning images and outstanding science the images central region containing the star cluster blends visible light data taken by the advanced camera for surveys and near infrared exposures taken by the wide field camera the surrounding region is composed of visible light observations taken by the advanced camera for surveys 

this nasa esa hubble space telescope image shows a globular cluster known as ngc or more commonly tucanae since it is part of the constellation of tucana the toucan in the southern sky after omega centauri it is the brightest globular cluster in the night sky hosting tens of thousands of stars scientists using hubble observed the white dwarfs in the cluster these dying stars migrate from the crowded centre of the cluster to its outskirts whilst astronomers knew about this process they had never seen it in action until the detailed study of tucanae 

the ghostly shells of galaxy eso are captured here in a new image from the nasa esa hubble space telescope set against a backdrop of distant galaxies the strikingly uneven structure and the clusters of stars that orbit around the galaxy suggest that eso may have been part of a dramatic collision sometime in its relatively recent past 

the twin jet nebula or pn m is a striking example of a bipolar planetary nebula bipolar planetary nebulae are formed when the central object is not a single star but a binary system studies have shown that the nebulas size increases with time and measurements of this rate of increase suggest that the stellar outburst that formed the lobes occurred just years ago 

this image shows a small section of the veil nebula as it was observed by the nasa esa hubble space telescope this section of the outer shell of the famous supernova remnant is in a region known as ngc or more colloquially the witchs broom nebula 

the bubble nebula also known as ngc is an emission nebula located light years away this stunning new image was observed by the nasa esa hubble space telescope to celebrate its th year in space 

this image taken with the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows the supernova remnant snr also known as nb top of the image nb was a type ia supernova located in the large magellanic cloud a neighbouring galaxy of the milky way owing to its relative proximity to earth astronomers observe the remnant to search for a potential stellar survivor of the explosion the orange red filaments visible in the image show the shock fronts of the supernova explosion these filaments allow astronomers to calculate the original centre of the explosion the filaments also show that the explosion is no longer expanding as a sphere but is elliptical in shape astronomers assume that part of material ejected by the explosion hit a denser cloud of interstellar material which slowed its speed the shell of expanding material being open to one side supports this idea the gas in the lower half of the image and the dense concentration of stars in the lower left are the outskirts of the star cluster ngc which has been observed by hubble in the past heic 

this composite image created out of two different pointings from hubble shows the barred spiral galaxy ngc left and the dwarf galaxy ngc right both galaxies are about million light years away from earth and currently in the process of merging at the end of this process ngc will have cannibalised its smaller companion 

this artists impression shows the view from the surface of one of the planets in the trappist system at least seven planets orbit this ultracool dwarf star light years from earth and they are all roughly the same size as the earth several of the planets are at the right distances from their star for liquid water to exist on the surfaces this artists impression is based on the known physical parameters of the planets and stars seen and uses a vast database of objects in the universe 

this image taken with the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows the galaxy ngc the scattered and warped appearance of the galaxy are the result of a past cosmic collision with another galaxy ngc not visible in this image the extreme tidal forces of the interaction between the two galaxies have carved out the shapes and properties of ngc once a barred spiral galaxy the outlying regions of ngc have been stretched out resulting in its nickname of the cocoon galaxy 

ngc df resides about million light years away in the ngc group which is dominated by a massive elliptical galaxy called ngc this large fuzzy looking galaxy is so diffuse that astronomers can clearly see distant galaxies behind it this ghostly galaxy is not well formed it does not look like a typical spiral galaxy but it does not look like an elliptical galaxy either based on the colours of its globular clusters the galaxy is about billion years old however even the globular clusters are strange they are twice as large as typical groups of stars all of these oddities pale in comparison to the weirdest aspect of this galaxy ngc df is missing most if not all of its dark matter the galaxy contains only a tiny fraction of dark matter that astronomers would expect for a galaxy this size but how it formed is a complete mystery hubble took this image on november using its advanced camera for surveys 

to celebrate its th anniversary in space the nasa esa hubble space telescope took this amazing and colourful image of the lagoon nebula the whole nebula about light years away is an incredible light years wide and light years tall this image shows only a small part of this turbulent star formation region about four light years across this stunning nebula was first catalogued in by the italian astronomer giovanni battista hodierna who sought to record nebulous objects in the night sky so they would not be mistaken for comets since hodiernas observations the lagoon nebula has been photographed and analysed by many telescopes and astronomers all over the world the observations were taken by hubbles wide field camera between february and february 

this image taken with the wide field camera wfc and the advanced camera for surveys acs both installed on the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows the peculiar galaxy ngc the galaxy is about million light years from earth and is the result of a past galactic merger which created its distorted appearance as such ngc provides an ideal target to investigate starbursts that have been triggered by galaxy mergers another image of ngc was already released in as part of a collection of interacting galaxies created for hubbles th birthday 

this image shows the recent observations of the planets mars and saturn made with the nasa esa hubble space telescope the observations of both objects were made in june and july and show the planets close to their opposition hubbles high resolution images of the planets and moons in our solar system can only be surpassed by pictures taken from spacecraft that actually visit them hubble even has one advantage over these probes it can look at these objects periodically and observe them over much longer periods than any passing probe could hubbles first observations of mars date back as far and the first observation of saturn was performed in the year hubble was launched 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope was used to observe the planet on june when saturn was approximately billion kilometres from earth visible in this hubble image are the classic rings as recorded by the very first astronomers to observe the planet with telescopes from the outside in are the a ring with the encke gap the cassini division the b ring and the c ring with the maxwell gap data from nasas cassini mission suggest that the rings formed about million years ago roughly around the time of the dinosaurs during the jurassic period the gravitational disintegration of one of saturns small moons created myriad icy debris particles and collisions lasting until today it is likely that they continually replenish the rings the planets banded structure clearly visible in the new image is caused by the winds and the clouds at different altitudes 

this image is a composite of observations made of saturn in early in the optical and of the auroras on saturns north pole region made in in contrast to the auroras on earth the auroras on saturn are only visible in the ultraviolet a part of the electromagnetic spectrum blocked by earths atmosphere and therefore astronomers have to rely on space telescopes like the nasa esa hubble space telescope to study them 

previously unseen details of a mysterious complex structure within the carina nebula ngc are revealed by this image of the keyhole nebula obtained with the hubble space telescope the picture is a montage assembled from four different april telescope pointings with hubbles wide field planetary camera which used six different colour filters the picture is dominated by a large approximately circular feature which is part of the keyhole nebula named in the th century by sir john herschel this region about light years from earth is located adjacent to the famous explosive variable star eta carinae which lies just outside the field of view toward the upper right the carina nebula also contains several other stars that are among the hottest and most massive known each about times as hot and times as massive as our sun 

just weeks after nasa astronauts repaired the hubble space telescope in december the hubble heritage project snapped this picture of ngc a nebula in the constellation orion the heritage astronomers in collaboration with scientists in texas and ireland used hubbles wide field planetary camera wfpc to obtain this colour image 

the hubble space telescope has caught the eerie wispy tendrils of a dark interstellar cloud being destroyed by the passage of one of the brightest stars in the pleiades star cluster like a flashlight beam shining off the wall of a cave the star is reflecting light off the surface of pitch black clouds of cold gas laced with dust these are called reflection nebulae 

the hubble telescope has captured an image of an unusual edge on galaxy revealing remarkable details of its warped dusty disk and showing how colliding galaxies spawn the formation of new generations of stars the dust and spiral arms of normal spiral galaxies like our own milky way appear flat when viewed edge on this hubble heritage image of eso g shows a galaxy that by contrast has an unusual twisted disk structure first seen in ground based photographs 

nc is the designation for a region of ionized hydrogen gas surrounding an association of young stars in the large magellanic cloud lmc a nearby small companion galaxy to the milky way visible from the southern hemisphere nc is part of the larger n complex which includes young hot massive stars nebulae and a superbubble blown out by multiple supernova explosions 

nasa esa hubble space telescope has trained its razor sharp eye on one of the universes most stately and photogenic galaxies the sombrero galaxy messier m the galaxys hallmark is a brilliant white bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy as seen from earth the galaxy is tilted nearly edge on we view it from just six degrees north of its equatorial plane this brilliant galaxy was named the sombrero because of its resemblance to the broad rim and high topped mexican hat at a relatively bright magnitude of m is just beyond the limit of naked eye visibility and is easily seen through small telescopes the sombrero lies at the southern edge of the rich virgo cluster of galaxies and is one of the most massive objects in that group equivalent to billion suns the galaxy is light years across and is located million light years from earth 

one of the largest hubble space telescope images ever made of a complete galaxy is being unveiled today at the american astronomical society meeting in san diego calif the hubble telescope captured a display of starlight glowing gas and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this foot by foot image of the barred spiral galaxy ngc ngc is considered to be prototypical of barred spiral galaxies barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not spiral all the way into the center but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars containing the nucleus at its center 

like dust bunnies that lurk in corners and under beds surprisingly complex loops and blobs of cosmic dust lie hidden in the giant elliptical galaxy ngc this image made from data obtained with the nasa esa hubble space telescope reveals the dust lanes and star clusters of this giant galaxy that give evidence that it was formed from a past merger of two gas rich galaxies 

this is a unique nasa esa hubble space telescope view of the disk galaxy ngc tilted nearly edge on to our line of sight hubbles sharp vision reveals a crisp dust lane dividing the galaxy into two halves the image highlights the galaxys structure a subtle reddish bulge surrounding a bright nucleus a blue disk of stars running parallel to the dust lane and a transparent outer halo some faint wispy trails of dust can be seen meandering away from the disk of the galaxy out into the bulge and inner halo of the galaxy the outer halo is dotted with numerous gravitationally bound clusters of nearly a million stars each known as globular clusters background galaxies that are millions to billions of light years farther away than ngc are also seen through the halo 

this nasa esa hubble space telescope photo shows the majestic spiral galaxy m in the midsts of this galaxy is the supernova j which was recently found to have a companion star which had been hidden in the glow of the supernova for years the location of the supernova can be seen in the annotated version of this image links nasa press release artists impression of supernova j supernova j in spiral galaxy m supernova j scenario for type iib supernova j 

this is an image of mycn a young planetary nebula located about light years away taken with the wide field and planetary camera wfpc aboard the hubble space telescope hst this hubble image reveals the true shape of mycn to be an hourglass with an intricate pattern of etchings in its walls this picture has been composed from three separate images taken in the light of ionized nitrogen represented by red hydrogen green and doubly ionized oxygen blue the results are of great interest because they shed new light on the poorly understood ejection of stellar matter which accompanies the slow death of sun like stars in previous ground based images mycn appears to be a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one but the fine details cannot be seen 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope has provided images of saturn in many colors from black and white to orange to blue green and red but in this picture image processing specialists have worked to provide a crisp extremely accurate view of saturn which highlights the planets pastel colors bands of subtle colour yellows browns grays distinguish differences in the clouds over saturn the second largest planet in the solar system 

in the direction of the constellation canis major two spiral galaxies pass by each other like majestic ships in the night the near collision has been caught in images taken by the nasa esa hubble space telescope and its wide field planetary camera 

this nasa esa hubble space telescope image of the trifid nebula reveals a stellar nursery being torn apart by radiation from a nearby massive star the picture also provides a peek at embryonic stars forming within an ill fated cloud of dust and gas which is destined to be eaten away by the glare from the massive neighbor this stellar activity is a beautiful example of how the life cycles of stars like our sun is intimately connected with their more powerful siblings 

this remarkable picture from the advanced camera for surveys on the nasa esa hubble space telescope shows one of the most perfect geometrical forms created in space it captures the formation of an unusual pre planetary nebula known as iras around the star ll pegasi also known as afgl in the constellation of pegasus the winged horse the striking picture shows what appears to be a thin spiral pattern of astonishingly regularity winding around the star which is itself hidden behind thick dust the spiral pattern suggests a regular periodic origin for the nebulas shape the material forming the spiral is moving outwards a speed of about km hour and by combining this speed with the distance between layers astronomers calculate that the shells are each separated by about years the spiral is thought to arise because ll pegasi is a binary system with the star that is losing material and a companion star orbiting each other the spacing between layers in the spiral is expected to directly reflect the orbital period of the binary which is indeed estimated to be also about years the creation and shaping of planetary nebulae is an exciting area of stellar evolution stars with masses from about half that of the sun up to about eight times that of the sun do not explode as supernovae at the ends of their lives instead a more regal end awaits them as their outer layers of gas are shed and drift into space creating striking and intricate structures that to earth bound observers often look like dramatic watercolour paintings iras is just starting this process and the central star has yet to emerge from the cocoon of enveloping dust this picture was created from images from the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys on hubble images through a yellow filter fw coloured blue were combined with images through a near infra red filter fw coloured red the exposure times were minutes and minutes respectively and the field of view spans about arcseconds links paper discussing the intriguing afgl pdf format 

the nasa esa hubble space telescope has snapped the best ever image of the antennae galaxies hubble has released images of these stunning galaxies twice before once using observations from its wide field and planetary camera wfpc in and again in from the advanced camera for surveys acs each of hubbles images of the antennae galaxies has been better than the last due to upgrades made during the famous servicing missions the last of which took place in the galaxies also known as ngc and ngc are locked in a deadly embrace once normal sedate spiral galaxies like the milky way the pair have spent the past few hundred million years sparring with one another this clash is so violent that stars have been ripped from their host galaxies to form a streaming arc between the two in wide field images of the pair the reason for their name becomes clear far flung stars and streamers of gas stretch out into space creating long tidal tails reminiscent of antennae this new image of the antennae galaxies shows obvious signs of chaos clouds of gas are seen in bright pink and red surrounding the bright flashes of blue star forming regions some of which are partially obscured by dark patches of dust the rate of star formation is so high that the antennae galaxies are said to be in a state of starburst a period in which all of the gas within the galaxies is being used to form stars this cannot last forever and neither can the separate galaxies eventually the nuclei will coalesce and the galaxies will begin their retirement together as one large elliptical galaxy this image uses visible and near infrared observations from hubbles wide field camera wfc along with some of the previously released observations from hubbles advanced camera for surveys acs 

this image from hubbles wide field and planetary camera wfpc is likely the best of ancient and brilliant quasar c which resides in a giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation of virgo the virgin its light has taken some billion years to reach us despite this great distance it is still one of the closest quasars to our home it was the first quasar ever to be identified and was discovered in the early s by astronomer allan sandage the term quasar is an abbreviation of the phrase quasi stellar radio source as they appear to be star like on the sky in fact quasars are the intensely powerful centres of distant active galaxies powered by a huge disc of particles surrounding a supermassive black hole as material from this disc falls inwards some quasars including c   have been observed to fire off super fast jets into the surrounding space in this picture one of these jets appears as a cloudy streak measuring some light years in length quasars are capable of emitting hundreds or even thousands of times the entire energy output of our galaxy making them some of the most luminous and energetic objects in the entire universe of these very bright objects c is the brightest in our skies if it was located light years from our own planet roughly seven times the distance between earth and proxima centauri the nearest star to us after the sun it would still appear as bright as the sun in the sky   wfpc was installed on hubble during shuttle mission sts it is the size of a small piano and was capable of seeing images in the visible near ultraviolet and near infrared parts of the spectrum 

the brightly glowing plumes seen in this image are reminiscent of an underwater scene with turquoise tinted currents and nebulous strands reaching out into the surroundings however this is no ocean this image actually shows part of the large magellanic cloud lmc a small nearby galaxy that orbits our galaxy the milky way and appears as a blurred blob in our skies the nasa esa hubble space telescope has peeked many times into this galaxy releasing stunning images of the whirling clouds of gas and sparkling stars opoa heic potwa this image shows part of the tarantula nebulas outskirts this famously beautiful nebula located within the lmc is a frequent target for hubble heic heic   in most images of the lmc the colour is completely different to that seen here this is because in this new image a different set of filters was used the customary r filter which selects the red light was replaced by a filter letting through the near infrared light in traditional images the hydrogen gas appears pink because it shines most brightly in the red here however other less prominent emission lines dominate in the blue and green filters this data is part of the archival pure parallel project appp a project that gathered together and processed over images taken using hubbles wide field planetary camera obtained in parallel with other hubble instruments much of the data in the project could be used to study a wide range of astronomical topics including gravitational lensing and cosmic shear exploring distant star forming galaxies supplementing observations in other wavelength ranges with optical data and examining star populations from stellar heavyweights all the way down to solar mass stars a version of this image was entered into the hubbles hidden treasures image processing competition by contestant josh barrington 

this neat little galaxy is known as ngc its dark lanes of dust and bright diffuse glow make the galaxy appear to hang like a halo in the emptiness of space in this new image from the nasa esa hubble space telescope although this image paints a picture of serenity the galaxy is anything but it is one of the brightest lenticular galaxies known a category that lies somewhere between spirals and ellipticals it has hosted two known supernova explosions one in and another in and is known to have a colossal supermassive black hole at its centre that has the mass of million suns ngc is part of the virgo cluster of galaxies ground based observations of galaxies in this cluster have revealed that a quarter of these galaxies seem to have rapidly rotating discs of gas at their centres the most spectacular of these is this galaxy ngc whose spinning disc of gas dust and stars reaches out uniquely far from its heart spanning some of the galaxys entire radius this disc is moving incredibly fast spinning at more than kilometres per second the dynamics of this quickly whirling region were actually used to infer the mass of ngc s central black hole a technique that had not been used before to constrain a galaxys central black hole this image was taken using hubbles wide field planetary camera   a version of this image was entered into the hubbles hidden treasures image processing competition by contestant judy schmidt hidden treasures was an initiative to invite astronomy enthusiasts to search the hubble archive for stunning images that have never been seen by the general public 

this new nasa esa hubble space telescope image shows the galaxy ic in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies ic is part of a galaxy group containing three other galaxies and located in the fornax galaxy cluster million light years away as seen in this image the disc of ic appears edge on from the vantage point of earth this makes it harder for astronomers to classify it as most of the characteristics of a galaxys morphology the arms of a spiral or the bar across the centre are only visible on its face still the light year long galaxy could be classified as an s type these lenticular galaxies are an intermediate state in galaxy morphological classification schemes between true spiral and elliptical galaxies they have a thin stellar disc and a bulge like spiral galaxies but in contrast to typical spiral galaxies they have used up most of the interstellar medium only a few new stars can be created out of the material that is left and the star formation rate is very low hence the population of stars in s galaxies consists mainly of aging stars very similar to the star population in elliptical galaxies as s galaxies have only ill defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face on or edge on as ic here and indeed despite the morphological differences between s and elliptical class galaxies they share a some common characteristics like typical sizes and spectral features both classes are also early type galaxies as they are evolving passively however elliptical galaxies may be passively evolving when we observe them but they had violent interactions with other galaxies in their past whereas s galaxies are either aging and fading spiral galaxies which never had any interactions with other galaxies or they are the aging result of a single merger between two spiral galaxies in the past the exact nature of these galaxies is still a matter of debate links structure and formation of s and spheroidal galaxies can early type galaxies evolve from fading the disks of late types 

this image shows the galaxy messier which lies in the small northern constellation of the hunting dogs about million light years away within the bright ring around messier new stars are forming at a high rate and many young bright stars are present within it thanks to this this feature is called a starburst ring the cause of this peculiarly shaped star forming region is likely a pressure wave going outwards from the galactic centre compressing the gas and dust in the outer region the compression of material means the gas starts to collapse into denser clouds inside these dense clouds gravity pulls the gas and dust together until temperature and pressure are high enough for stars to be born 

ever since voyager beamed home spectacular images of the planets in the s planet lovers have been hooked on extra terrestrial aurorae aurorae are caused by streams of charged particles like electrons that come from various origins such as solar winds the planetary ionosphere and moon volcanism they become caught in powerful magnetic fields and are channelled into the upper atmosphere where their interactions with gas particles such as oxygen or nitrogen set off spectacular bursts of light the alien aurorae on jupiter and saturn are well studied but not much is known about the aurorae of the giant ice planet uranus in the nasa esa hubble space telescope became the first earth based telescope to snap an image of the aurorae on uranus in and a team led by an astronomer from paris observatory took a second look at the aurorae using the ultraviolet capabilities of the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis installed on hubble they tracked the interplanetary shocks caused by two powerful bursts of solar wind travelling from the sun to uranus then used hubble to capture their effect on uranus aurorae and found themselves observing the most intense aurorae ever seen on the planet by watching the aurorae over time they collected the first direct evidence that these powerful shimmering regions rotate with the planet they also re discovered uranus long lost magnetic poles which were lost shortly after their discovery by voyager in due to uncertainties in measurements and the featureless planet surface this is a composite image of uranus by voyager and two different observations made by hubble one for the ring and one for the aurorae 

its beginning to look a lot like christmas in this nasa esa hubble space telescope image of a blizzard of stars which resembles a swirling storm in a snow globe these stars make up the globular cluster messier located about light years from earth in the constellation of lepus the hare globular clusters are gravitationally bound groupings of up to one million stars these giant star globes contain some of the oldest stars in our galaxy messier is no exception it contains about stars packed into an area measuring just roughly light years across this billion year old star cluster was first discovered by french astronomer pierre mã©chain in mã©chain reported the finding to his colleague charles messier who included it in his catalogue of non cometary objects the messier catalogue about four years later using a larger telescope than messiers william herschel was able to resolve the stars in messier and described it as a globular star cluster in this sparkling hubble image sun like stars appear yellow white and the reddish stars are bright giants that are in the final stages of their lives most of the blue stars sprinkled throughout the cluster are aging helium burning stars which have exhausted their hydrogen fuel and are now fusing helium in their cores 

this image shows something spectacular a massive galaxy cluster that it is warping the space around it the cluster whose heart is at the centre of the frame is named rcs j and is one of the most massive clusters known at its distance or beyond massive objects such as rcs j have such a strong influence on their surroundings that they visibly warp the space around them this effect is known as gravitational lensing in this way they cause the light from more distant objects to be bent distorted and magnified allowing us to see galaxies that would otherwise be far too distant to detect gravitational lensing is one of the predictions of einsteins theory of general relativity strong lensing produces stunning images of distorted galaxies and sweeping arcs both of which can be seen in this image weak gravitational lensing on the other hand is more subtle hardly seen directly in an image and is mostly studied statistically but it provides a way to measure the masses of cosmic objects as in the case of this cluster this image is a composite of observations from the hawk i instrument on esos very large telescope and the nasa esa hubble space telescopes advanced camera for surveys it demonstrates an impressively detailed collaborative approach to studying weak lensing in the cosmos the study found rcs j to contain the mass of two quadrillion suns the diffuse blue and white image covering the picture shows a mass map it is connected to the amount of mass thought to be contained within each region links galaxy cluster rcs j comparison image hubble and hawk i explore a cluster with the mass of two quadrillion suns 

this image shows the galaxy cluster rcs j the mass of the cluster causes both strong and weak gravitational lensing which can be used to calculate the mass of the cluster this image is a composite of observations from the hawk i instrument on esos very large telescope and the nasa esa hubble space telescopes advanced camera for surveys it demonstrates an impressively detailed collaborative approach to studying weak lensing in the cosmos links hubble and hawk i explore a cluster with the mass of two quadrillion suns comparison image hubble and hawk i explore a cluster with the mass of two quadrillion suns 

in astronomers using the nasa esa hubble space telescope found that this enormous galaxy cluster contains the mass of a staggering three million billion suns so its little wonder that it has earned the nickname of el gordo the fat one in spanish known officially as act clj it is the largest hottest and x ray brightest galaxy cluster ever discovered in the distant universe galaxy clusters are the largest objects in the universe that are bound together by gravity they form over billions of years as smaller groups of galaxies slowly come together in observations from esos very large telescope nasas chandra x ray observatory and the atacama cosmology telescope showed that el gordo is actually composed of two galaxy clusters colliding at millions of kilometres per hour the formation of galaxy clusters depends heavily on dark matter and dark energy studying such clusters can therefore help shed light on these elusive phenomena in hubble found that most of el gordos mass is concealed in the form of dark matter evidence suggests that el gordos normal matter largely composed of hot gas that is bright in the x ray wavelength domain is being torn from the dark matter in the collision the hot gas is slowing down while the dark matter is not this image was taken by hubbles advanced camera for surveys and wide field camera as part of an observing programme called relics reionization lensing cluster survey relics imaged massive galaxy clusters with the aim of finding the brightest distant galaxies for the forthcoming nasa esa csa james webb space telescope jwst to study 

this image from the nasa esa hubble space telescope reveals a glistening and ancient globular cluster named ngc a gathering of hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity ngc was discovered in by the scottish astronomer james dunlop who described it as a pretty large pretty bright object that becomes rather irregular towards its centre globular clusters are found around all large galaxies but their origin and role in galaxy formation remain tantalisingly unclear astronomers recently discovered a black hole lurking at the heart of ngc its position was revealed by the strange movements of a star being quickly flung around a massive invisible counterpart this sparkling group of stars also has some strange properties which make it unique amongst the over globular clusters belonging to the milky way ngc has an extremely fast velocity with respect to the sun and its orbit is retrograde meaning that it moves speedily in the opposite direction to the galactic centre which it orbits the unusual behaviour of this cluster suggests that it may have extragalactic origins but at some point was captured by the milky ways gravity however the chemical makeup of this intriguing cluster tells a different story the stars within ngc are chemically very similar to those of other galactic globular clusters implying that they formed at a similar location and time to their neighbours whether this mysterious cluster was adopted by our galaxy or has for some reason evolved very differently to the family of clusters it grew up with it is certainly an unusual astronomical beauty acknowledgement sarajedini et al 

this nasa esa hubble space telescope image shows a spiral galaxy known as ngc first spotted by the prolific galaxy hunter william herschel in ngc is located about million light years away in the constellation of pegasus the winged horse facing us partially edge on the galaxy showcases its beautiful arms which swirl like a whirlpool around its bright central region astronomers took this image using hubbles wide field camera wfc as they were observing an extraordinary exploding star a supernova which can still be faintly seen as a tiny red dot near the galaxys central yellow core named snc it rapidly evolved from a supernova containing very little hydrogen to one that is hydrogen rich in just one year this rarely observed metamorphosis was luminous at high energies and provides unique insight into the poorly understood final phases of massive stars ngc is similar in size shape and mass to the milky way it also has a comparable star formation rate hosts a similar number of stars has a central supermassive black hole and comparable spiral arms the primary difference between our galaxies is that ngc is an unbarred spiral galaxy it lacks a bar of stars gas and dust cutting through its nucleus as we see in the milky way its central bulge also displays a quirky and unusual rotation pattern spinning in the opposite direction to the galactic disc itself by studying similar galaxies we hold a scientific mirror up to our own allowing us to build a better understanding of our galactic environment which we cannot always observe and of galactic behaviour and evolution as a whole 

this stunning image from hubble shows the majestic galaxy ngc found nestled within the constellation of cetus the whale million light years from earth in this image we see ngc face on with its beautifully symmetrical swirling arms and bright central bulge creating a scene akin to a sparkling catherine wheel firework ngc has a bright fairly large centre and smooth tightly wound spiral arms and a central bar of gas and stars this shape leads ngc to be classified as a barred spiral galaxy just like our home the milky way bars are found in around two thirds of all spiral galaxies and the arms of this galaxy swirl outwards from a pale yellow ring encircling the bar itself scientists believe that any hungry black holes lurking at the centre of barred spirals funnel gas and energy from the outer arms into the core via these glowing bars feeding the black hole fueling star birth at the centre and building up the galaxys central bulge in a type ia supernova named sn ig was spotted in ngc one of the bright dots to the upper right of the galaxys centre these types of supernovae are extremely important they are all caused by exploding white dwarfs which have companion stars and always peak at the same brightness billion times brighter than the sun knowing the true brightness of these events and comparing this with their apparent brightness gives astronomers a unique chance to measure distances in the universe 

though the bright light speckled foreground galaxy on the left is eye catching it is far from the most intriguing object in this nasa esa hubble space telescope image in the upper part of the frame the light from distant galaxies has been smeared and twisted into odd shapes arcs and streaks this phenomenon indicates the presence of a giant galaxy cluster which is bending the light coming from the galaxies behind it with its monstrous gravitational influence this cluster called sdssj lies some three billion light years away and was first documented by the sloan digital sky survey sdss hence its name the sdss uses a metre optical telescope located at the apache point observatory in new mexico to observe millions of objects and create detailed d maps of the universe this particular cluster was part of the sloan giant arcs survey sgas which detected galaxy clusters with strong lensing properties their gravity stretches and warps the light of more distant galaxies sitting behind them creating weird and spectacular arcs such as those seen here the hubble data on of sdssj were part of a study of star formation in brightest cluster galaxies called bcgs lying between approximately and billion light years away this study found the star formation rate in these galaxies to be low which is consistent with models that suggest that most stars in such galaxies form very early on these bcgs also emit strong radio signals thought to be from active galactic nuclei agn at their centers suggesting that the activity from both the agn and any ongoing star formation is fuelled by cold gas found within the host galaxies 

at first glance this image is dominated by the vibrant glow of the swirling spiral to the lower left of the frame however this galaxy is far from the most interesting spectacle here behind it sits a galaxy cluster galaxies are not randomly distributed in space they swarm together gathered up by the unyielding hand of gravity to form groups and clusters the milky way is a member of the local group which is part of the virgo cluster which in turn is part of the galaxy strong laniakea supercluster the galaxy cluster seen in this image is known as sdss j clusters such as this can help astronomers understand the distant and therefore early universe sdss j was imaged as part of a study of star formation in far flung galaxies star forming regions are typically not very large stretching out for a few hundred light years at most so it is difficult for telescopes to resolve them at a distance even using its most sensitive and highest resolution cameras hubble cannot resolve very distant star forming regions so astronomers use a cosmic trick they search instead for galaxy clusters which have a gravitational influence so immense that they warp the spacetime around them this distortion acts like a lens magnifying the light of galaxies sitting far behind the cluster and producing elongated arcs like the one seen to the left of centre in this image 

this nasa esa hubble space telescope image shows a cluster of hundreds of galaxies located about billion light years from earth the brightest galaxy within this cluster named sdss j and known as the brightest cluster galaxy bcg is visible in the lower middle of the frame it was discovered by the sloan giant arcs survey which studied data maps covering huge parts of the sky from the sloan digital sky survey it found more than galaxies that look to be significantly affected by a cosmic phenomenon known as gravitational lensing gravitational lensing is one of the predictions of albert einsteins general theory of relativity the mass contained within a galaxy is so immense that it can actually warp and bend the very fabric of its surroundings known as spacetime forcing the light to travel along curved paths as a result the image of a more distant galaxy appears distorted and amplified to an observer as the light from it has been bent around the intervening galaxy this effect can be very useful in astronomy allowing astronomers to see galaxies that are either obscured or too distant for us to be otherwise detected by our current instruments galaxy clusters are giant structures containing hundreds to thousands of galaxies with masses of about over one million billion times the mass of the sun sdss j is only roughly billion times the mass of the sun making it less massive than the average galaxy however it is massive enough to produce the fuzzy greenish streak seen just below the brightest galaxy the lensed image of a more distant galaxy
